# Overview

This assignment allows me to experiment more with API's and also allows me to work with HTML, CSS, and javascript which are all different ways of coding which helps me to get a broader understanding of coding as a whole which is ultimately my goal for this assignment.

The assignment is a simple webpage that allows you to type in a movie ID or title of a starwars movie and then the the program will find the movie and display some basic information about the movie.

# Development Environment

For this assignment I used visual studio code to write the program and google chrome as program that will display and use the code in a webpage.

# Future Work


Want to expand the assignment and make it able to take a character name and display more information about that character such as what movies there in and more of their backstory.
